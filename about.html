<h1>About .Bun </h1> 

<p>I'd been wanting to make a little website from scratch to teach myself about raw components of the web. 
I wanted more than static HTML, so I figured I'd throw in some php as well. As for the domain name? ...this 
was a result of a fun train of thought. I was thinking about the slashdot name, and how is was chosen because 
of how it sounds when said out-loud (ach tee tee pee colon slash slash slash dot dot com), so I went looking 
around to see if any other fun "dot" domains were open.</p>

<p>The first one I found was dotbun.com. I just had to come up with something to put on it...</p>

<p>Since 'bun' is often used to refer to especially cute rabbits, I decided to grab some rabbit images and 
show them randomly.I added a static link creator and refresh button, and most recently added embedded 
mp4/webms. This is still a work in progress, so expect to see changes from time to time.</p>

<h2>Some Nerd Stuff</h2>

<p>When you load the main page, a little php script selects a random file name. 
If its a still image (png/jpg) it produces html that will attempt to show a webp picture, with a fallback to the original format. 
I also made the static links the original format, to make them more accessible to hotlinking and sharing.</p>

<p>If its a gif, it displays it without fallback (since webp doesn't handle moving images).
If the random file is a video, it instead generates a &lt;video&gt;  tag that is set to maximum size without affecting aspect ratio, 
centered in the screen. I use the tag &lt;video autoplay loop&gt; for gif-like behavior.<p>

<p>I used media selectors to make the website somewhat responsive. If your horizontal size is below a given limit, the static link and 
refresh buttons are enlarged and moved from the corners to the top and bottom of the page.</p>

<p>By opportunistically using webp, and relying on php pre-processing with NO javascript, I got a 100 on both desktop and mobile according to google's pageSpeed insights.</p>

<h2> To-Do List </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Data Rights Handling</li>
  <li>Upload page - allow submissions</li>
  <li>Backward/Forward Navigation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Management</h2>
The website dotbun.com has no ads, and is not monitized. I use <a href="https://dotbun.goatcounter.com">GoatCounter</a> to keep track of basic stats, but these stats are completely anonymized and do not follow you off this site. To quote the developer of GoatCounter:
<blockquote cite="https://www.arp242.net/dnt.html">
To give a real-world analogy: it just counts how many people are entering your shop through which door. What it doesn’t do is then follow those people after they’ve left your store to see which other stores they visit, snoop on as much personal details as possible, and create a profile based on that. That’s what tracking is, and is just not the same thing as what GoatCounter is doing.

Please note that improving this process is something I'm actively working on.
