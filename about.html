    <h1>About .Bun </h1>

    <p>I'd been wanting to make a little website from scratch to teach myself about raw components of the web. I wanted more than static HTML, so I figured I'd throw in some php as well. As for the domain name? ...this was a result of a fun train of thought.
        I was thinking about the slashdot name, and how is was chosen because of how it sounds when said out-loud (ach tee tee pee colon slash slash slash dot dot com), so I went looking around to see if any other fun "dot" domains were open.</p>

    <p>The first one I found was dotbun.com. I just had to come up with something to put on it...</p>

    <p>Since 'bun' is <a href="https://xkcd.com/1682/">often</a> <a href="https://xkcd.com/1871/">used</a> to refer to <a href="https://xkcd.com/1903/">especially cute</a> <a href="https://xkcd.com/2349/">rabbits</a>, I decided to grab some rabbit images
        and show them randomly.I added a static link creator and refresh button, and most recently added embedded mp4/webms. This is still a work in progress, so expect to see changes from time to time.
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Backward/Forward Navigation</li>
            <li>Selective element reloading (not the whole page)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Management</h2>
        The website dotbun.com has no ads, and is not monitized. I use <a href="https://dotbun.goatcounter.com">GoatCounter</a> to keep track of basic stats, but these stats are completely anonymized and do not follow you off this site. To quote the developer
        of GoatCounter:
        <blockquote cite="https://www.arp242.net/dnt.html">
            To give a real-world analogy: it just counts how many people are entering your shop through which door. What it doesn’t do is then follow those people after they’ve left your store to see which other stores they visit, snoop on as much personal details
            as possible, and create a profile based on that. That’s what tracking is, and is just not the same thing as what GoatCounter is doing.
        </blockquote>
